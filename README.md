Wireless Water level controlling and management system introduces an IoT enabled gadget which helps in administering and monitoring the consumption of water in multiple buildings simultaneously.
This module can be effortlessly fixed onto desired water containers and carry on for long run.
The Ultrasonic sensor is placed on the top of tank which continuously keeps track of the water level in real time, which will inform the users about the level of liquid and automatically turn on/off 
the water pump as per the definedfunctions.
This figure will be regularly revised on the website, so that the user can analyze the amount of water usage and thus, control the wastage.
According to the level of water in the tank, the motor functioning is automatically controlled.
When the surface level drops below the threshold measure, the motor will be again switched on impulsively.
